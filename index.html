        <p>
            There are several popular misconceptions about healthy eating. People often mistakenly believe that healthy foods are expensive, time-consuming to cook, and are not filling. This couldn't be further from the truth!
            For starters fruits and vegetables are often priced at a lower price per pound than the equivalent in junkfood. For instance a pound of bananas might cost 49 cents whereas a small bag of chips could cost a whole dollar
            and offer far less per pound! You would be getting all the nutrition of the banana and the fillingness of the fiber.
